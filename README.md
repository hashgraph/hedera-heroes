# What is Hedera Heroes? 🦸‍♀️
Hedera Heroes is an effort to encourage developer community collaboration by rewarding you for sharing lessons learned, how-to tutorials, and other informative articles on the  <a href="https://www.hedera.com/blog/">Hedera blog</a>. In return, once your submission is approved you'll receive $100 USD worth of hbar once your post is published. 

# What can I write about? ✍️
Whatever you like, as long as it is helpful for other developers building on Hedera. Topics can range from more theoretical architectures to how to use Hedera File Service to manage credential checks with Java. Check out this <a href="https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-heroes/issues">repository's issues for topics</a> we're looking for and inspirational ideas. 

If you want to write about something not covered in the issues section, we welcome that, too. As long as you think that another developer would find your piece helpful, then you should write about it; just be sure to submit the form below first to get it approved.

# Great, how do I participate? 🥳
Simply fill out this <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/hedera-heroes">Hedera Heroes form</a> to get started. Once received, we'll respond to make sure you're on the right track, not covering the same topic as someone else, and able to be rewarded. Once we review and accept your submission we'll post it on the <a href="https://www.hedera.com/blog/">Hedera blog</a>; if you have your own blog you're welcome to post there, too. 

If you choose to write on one of the <a href="https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-heroes/issues">GitHub issues topics</a> please comment in the related issue to let others know you're actively working on it.
