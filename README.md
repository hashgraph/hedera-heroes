# What is Hedera Heroes? ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Hedera Heroes is an effort to encourage developer community collaboration by rewarding you for sharing lessons learned, how-to tutorials, and other informative articles on the  <a href="https://www.hedera.com/blog/">Hedera blog</a>. In return, once your submission is approved you'll receive a $100 USD reward once your post is published. 

# What can I write about? ‚úçÔ∏è
Whatever you like, as long as it is helpful for other developers building on Hedera. Topics can range from more theoretical architectures to how to use Hedera File Service to manage credential checks with Java. Check out this <a href="https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-heroes/issues">repository's issues for topics</a> we're looking for and inspirational ideas. 

If you want to write about something not covered in the issues section, we welcome that, too. As long as you think that another developer would find your piece helpful, then you should write about it; just be sure to submit the form below first to get it approved.
